Each {es} node, {ls} node, {kib} instance, and Beat is considered unique in the
cluster based on its persistent UUID, which is written to the
<<path-settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node or instance starts.

Monitoring documents are just ordinary JSON documents built by monitoring each 
{stack} component at a specified collection interval. If you want to alter the
templates for these indices, see <<config-monitoring-indices>>.

Each component in the {stack} is responsible for monitoring itself and then
forwarding those documents to the production cluster for both routing and
indexing (storage). The routing and indexing processes in {es} are handled by
what are called <<es-monitoring-collectors,collectors>> and 
<<es-monitoring-exporters,exporters>>. In the past, collectors and exporters
were considered to be part of a monitoring "agent", but that term is generally
not used anymore.
